You have arrived at an asteroid field!

Luckily, you are piloting a Scout class vessel.
Anything heavier and it's not expected to leave here better than you entered.
That's not to say you will not meet any opposition however, the rebels have scouts of their own to search these parts.
Any fights here will be messy with all the debris floating about. Fun!
