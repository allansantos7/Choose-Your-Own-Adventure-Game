You have arrived at a Hostile sector.

Various pirate sects control these parts because of its lawless nature.
The ruling pirate sect changes day by day, week by week, a fortnight, you get the picture.
Be prepared.
Hostile forces are rampant as soon as they detect or take a gander at that little Federation vessel you got there,
they will want a piece (mostly the whole thing though) of that.
You may even end up caught in a pirate turf war.

Expect to fight! You can handle it though right?
