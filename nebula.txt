You have arrived at a Nebula sector.

Keep your eyes peeled!
Nebula sectors are mostly full of various gas formations throughout, clouding your vision and sensors!

You could encounter nothing or anything in these uncharted parts.

On the plus side, nebulas have minerals scattered in the sector that the ship can convert into fuel!

Happy findings!
