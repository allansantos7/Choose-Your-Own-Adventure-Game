Choose Your Own Adventure!

You are a messenger of the Galactic Federation.  You have an important message that must be delivered to Federation Headquarters.
Unfortunately, due to the sensitive nature of this information, it must be delivered in person.

Most importantly, this information is stolen from the Rebel base and so now they're after you!

Your ship is a state of the art Federation ship meant for speed and evasion, perfect for a messenger.
It has a basic twin laser cannon for self defense, not meant for prolonged fights or against heavy class warships/frigates.
This information will be important to keep in mind while trying to complete your objective.

Your current objective is to run! Defeat any obstacles in your way, at all costs!
