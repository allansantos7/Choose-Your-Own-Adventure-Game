<h1> Choose Your Own Adventure! Game using Python </h1></br>

Story: </br>
You are a messenger of the Galactic Federation.  You have an important message that must be delivered to Federation Headquarters.</br>
Unfortunately, due to the sensitive nature of this information, it must be delivered in person. </br>

Most importantly, this information is stolen from the Rebel base and so now they're after you! </br>

Your ship is a state of the art Federation ship meant for speed and evasion, perfect for a messenger. </br>
It has a basic twin laser cannon for self defense, not meant for prolonged fights or against heavy class warships/frigates. </br>
This information will be important to keep in mind while trying to complete your objective. </br>

Your current objective is to run! Defeat any obstacles in your way, at all costs! </br>
