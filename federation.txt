You have arrived at Federation HQ!

You hear that?  That sound right there is the sound of a sector filled with harmony and progress.
The sector youâ€™ve arrived in is at the heart of the Federation, Federation HQ!
You fought, overcame obstacles to make it to this point. You survived.
After delivering the intel, they may even promote you (probably not). Congratulations!
