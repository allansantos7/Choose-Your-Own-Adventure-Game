You are 1 sector away from reaching HQ and the two closest sectors are of equal distance to each other.
You can only jump to one of the two, which do you jump to:

1: Civilian Sector
    - sector that mostly house civilian planets with lots of security, making it safe for trade

2: Nebula Sector
    - Lots of vapour throughout the sector, sensors are having a hard time determining what exactly is in this sector.
