Pulling all the courage you have, you tactically retreat.

As soon as you turn your ship to run away,
You receive a transmission... It's from the drone!

"I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't let you do that."

Wait... Your name's not Dave....

You put all power to engines to try to gain distance between you and the drone.
The drone catches up to you, you must fight it to escape.
