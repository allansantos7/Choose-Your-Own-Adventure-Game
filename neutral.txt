You have arrived at a neutral sector.

Neutral sectors are neither particularly dangerous nor safe. They are, regarding sectors, very much a wildcard.
While it's preferable to not enter in guns blazing, lowering your guard in these parts is foolish.
Mercenaries, pirates , and traveling traders are expected.  That's not to say all encounters will be met with good
intentions.  Stay vigilant...
